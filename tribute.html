		<h1>Kalpana Chawla</h1>
        <img src="Kalpana-Chawla.jpg" alt="Kalpana Chawla">

        <p>Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, India. She earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College before moving to the United States to pursue her dream of becoming an astronaut.</p>
    
        <p>Chawla joined NASA in 1995 and flew her first space mission in 1997 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. She went on to fly a second mission in 2003, but tragically, the shuttle disintegrated upon re-entry, killing all seven crew members, including Chawla.</p>
    
        <p>Despite her untimely death, Kalpana Chawla's legacy lives on as a trailblazer for women in STEM and an inspiration to all those who dream of exploring the unknown.</p>
